### Note Randomizer

I'm trying to memorize all the notes on the guitar fretboard so I figured I'd build this silly 'ol vanilla JS script to help me keep me on my toes while I'm practicing it. 

Just clone the repo and run the html file in your browser if you want to use it, but I'd be surprised if anybody else reads this lols.
